# Fork of ciri/comfyui-model-downloader 

With the following improvements:

- Generalized URL parsing. Can take huggingface or civitai URLs in full.
  - Any of the following will work for Civitai:
     - `https://civitai.com/models/1234567?modelVersionId=2345678`
     - `2345678`
     - `https://civitai.com/api/download/models/2345678?type=Model&format=SafeTensor`
     - `https://civitai.com/api/download/models/2345678`
    - Any of the following will work for Huggingface:
     - `https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Qwen-Image-Lightning/resolve/main/Qwen-Image-Lightning-4steps-V2.0.safetensors`
     - `https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Qwen-Image-Lightning/resolve/main/Qwen-Image-Lightning-4steps-V2.0.safetensors?download=true`
     - `https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Qwen-Image-Lightning/blob/main/Qwen-Image-Lightning-4steps-V2.0.safetensors`
     -  `lightx2v/Qwen-Image-Lightning/blob/main/Qwen-Image-Lightning-4steps-V2.0.safetensors`

- Ability to cancel download at any time (automatically deletes incomplete file)
- Automatic file path scanning so you can download to the correct directories when the node runs
- Added overwrite toggle for Civitai downloader

## Introduction
This project provides an improved experimental model downloader node for ComfyUI, designed to simplify the process of downloading and managing models in environments with restricted access or complex setup requirements. It aims to enhance the flexibility and usability of ComfyUI by enabling seamless integration and management of machine learning models.

## Features
- **Easy Model Downloading**: Simplify the process of downloading models directly within the ComfyUI environment.
- **Repositories**: Currently supports hugging face and CivitAI.
- **User-friendly**: Designed with a focus on ease of use, making model management accessible to users of all skill levels.

## Available Nodes

### HF Downloader

Parameters:

* model_url: Hugging Face repo ID or URL
* filename: filename to download from the repository
* save_dir: destination directory
* overwrite: overwrite existing file if it exists

### CivitAI Downloader

Parameters:
* model_url: CivitAI model ID or URL
* token_id: CivitAI token ID
* save_dir: destination directory

## Auto Model Finder (Experimental)

![Auto](assets/auto-downloader.png?raw=true)

Automatically searches for known files (e.g., .safetensors, .ckpt, etc) files in your canvas and looks for repositories containing them on Hugging Face. Ideally, you should use this together with the HF Downloader node to automatically download any missing models.

Troubleshooting: this node is experimental and may not work as expected. If it doesn't work, try removing the node and adding it again.

## Installation

### Via Git Clone

Clone the repository or download the extension directly into your ComfyUI project's `custom_nodes` folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/fuselayer/model-downloader-comfyui.git
```

## Usage
To use the model downloader within your ComfyUI environment:
1. Open your ComfyUI project.
2. Find the `HF Downloader` or `CivitAI Downloader` node.
3. Configure the node properties with the URL or identifier of the model you wish to download and specify the destination path.
4. Execute the node to start the download process.
5. To avoid repeated downloading, make sure to bypass the node after you've downloaded a model.

## Roadmap (tentative)
- [x] Add persistance for auto model finder between runs
- [ ] Add more model finders (including CivitAI)
- [ ] Add more downloaders
- [ ] Add authentication for HF Downloader
